    <h1>Priveate Life of George Washington</h1>
     <H5> Life After the Presidency</H5>



<p> Only two years after leaving the presidency, George Washington died. Mount Vernon had been neglected for decades, and Washington spent the most of his remaining days attempting to bring it back to life. However, as relations with France deteriorated in mid-1799, Washington was reassigned to public service when President Adams nominated him commander of the American Army.However, the old general was beginning to show his age, and his responsibilities had been reduced to primarily symbolic duty. He was adamant about handing over command of the army to Hamilton.

"At around ten o'clock it began to snow, soon after hail, and then to a persistent cold rain," Washington wrote in his diary on December 12, 1799. Washington had been out on horseback exploring his land for five hours that day.He complained of a sore throat the next day, and he fell seriously unwell that night. Doctors took blood from him and performed other procedures that caused him more harm than benefit, following medical tenets of the day. Washington, on the other hand, never complained about the discomfort. He quietly delivered orders to the maids and apologized for causing everyone so much worry. He took his last breath about midnight.The funeral for George Washington was not the simple ceremony he had requested. Thousands of mourners attended the funeral, which featured a band and a ceremonial salute fired by a ship anchored in the Potomac. At Mount Vernon, he was laid to rest in the family tomb.
In his forty-two-page testament, which he personally penned in 1799, he gave his $500,000 inheritance to Martha for her lifetime, after which it would pass to his nephew, Bushrod Washington. He released his personal slave, William, with a $30 stipend that he would receive every year for the rest of his life, and he ordered the rest of his slaves to be freed when Martha died.

Washington bequeathed a portion of his fortune to a school for destitute and orphaned children, as well as funds to help build a national university in Washington, D.C. He bequeathed substantial, desirable tracts of farmland in Virginia to his two grandsons, as well as gifts drawn from his household and personal things to his many friends.

Washington's five nephews inherited his five swords along with the instructions to never "unsheath them for the purpose of shedding blood, except it be for self defence, or in defence of their Country and its rights; and in the latter case, to keep them unsheathed, and prefer falling with them in their hands, to the relinquishment thereof."  </p>
