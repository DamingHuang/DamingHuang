<p>Antiquated myths tell us that around 1300 a long time back when the national capital was built in Nara, Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto came all the way from Kashima Holy place (Ibaraki Prefecture) to Mt. Mikasa, which is considered a heavenly mountain, to stay on its summit “Ukigumo-no-mine” for the success of the country and bliss of the individuals. Afterward on, when Tempyo Culture prospered, the political pioneer Fujiwara-no-Nagate built wonderful buildings on the show location of the holy place as appointed by Ruler Shotoku. On November 9, 768, he cherished a few divine beings here, specifically Futsunushi-no-mikoto from Katori Holy place (Chiba Prefecture), and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto and Himegami from Hiraoka Holy place (Osaka Prefecture). Usually how Kasuga Taisha started.</p>
